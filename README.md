# vuexfire-example

This project is a Vue.js application that connects with a Firebase backend to manage books. It's a simple example to show how Vuexfire can simplify the Vuex store management as it keeps the state on sync with the backend without the need to write mutations.

An article explaining this project can be found [in this article in my blog](https://antonioufano.com/articles/use-vuexfire-to-simplify-your-application-state-management).
